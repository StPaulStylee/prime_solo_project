### What is Real Hold 'em?
The market for play money poker applications is riddled with gimmicks - Real Hold â€˜Em aims to strip away the
artifice and allow users to play pure and simple Texas Hold'em.

###Tech Used:
JavaScript, Socket.io, AngularJS, Express.js, Passport.js, PostgreSQL, and CSS

### To Do's
Currently, the app is incomplete. In order for it to be a functional poker application I must:
* Automate the process for hand progression (Flop, Turn, River, Showdown)
* Implement a poker hand evaluator so at showdown the winning hand can be determined
* Expand the code so that it fully functions with up to 10 players at the table.

### Stretch Goals:
* Style the playing cards are actual card images and not just text
* Style the game view so that it appears players are sitting at a actual virtual poker table
* Implement a game lobby so users can access the game of there liking
* Implement an "Bank Account" page so users can view how much play money they have in their account
* Create an admin side of the application where the admin can view user data and create/delete tables.
